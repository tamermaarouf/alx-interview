'''
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you.
Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1
and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.
Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.
Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
boxes is a list of lists
A key with the same number as a box opens that box
You can assume all keys will be positive integers
There can be keys that do not have boxes
The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
