# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Must Know
* For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concept and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:
## Concepts Needed:
* Lists and List Manipulation:
    Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
    [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
    * Graph Theory Basics:
        * Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
        * [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs)
    * Algorithmic Complexity:
        * Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
        * [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)
    * Recursion:
        * Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.

    * Queue and Stack:
        * Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
        * [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)]()
    * Set Operations:
        * Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
