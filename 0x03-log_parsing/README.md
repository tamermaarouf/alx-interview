#  0x03. Log Parsing
For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on
parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data.
Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:

## Concepts Needed:
File I/O in Python:
*    Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
*    [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

Signal Handling in Python:

*    Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
*    [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)
Data Processing:
*    Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
*    Aggregating data to compute summaries.
Regular Expressions:

*    Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
*    [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
Dictionaries in Python:

*    Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
*    [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
Exception Handling:

*    Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
*    [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
